## **Question 1 [60pt] Visualization of the `mpg` data set**

This data set contains fuel economy data 1999 - 2008 for 38 popular car models (source: EPA [http://fueleconomy.gov](http://fueleconomy.gov)).

```{r, collapse=T}
?mpg
dim(mpg)  # dimension of the table
names(mpg)  # list the variables in mpg
str(mpg)  # list the structures in mpg
glimpse(mpg) # get a glimpse of the mpg data
```

### (a) [10pt] Aesthetic mapping of `color`

(i) What's gone wrong with the following code? Why are the points not blue?
2
```{r, collapse=T}
ggplot(data = mpg) + # plot mpg data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue")) 
```

**ANSWER:** The code doesn't work because color should't be within the **aes** parentheses when it's not defined by a variable within the dataset. 

Modify the code to plot blue points.

**ANSWER:**

```{r, collapse=T}
# Enter your code here
ggplot(data = mpg) + # plot the mpg data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue") # color points blue
```

(ii) What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`? Note, you'll also need to specify x and y.

**ANSWER:** When such a thing is done, the displacements less than 5 will be a different color than the ones that are greater than or equal to 5.

```{r, collapse=T}
# Enter your code here
ggplot(data = mpg) + # plot mpg data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ<5)) # plot data and color point less than 5 a different color
```


### (b) [20pt] Reproduce the following plots

When generating the plots, focus on the aesthetic mappings in the reference plot. It is OK if the text font size or point size in your plot look different from the reference plot.

**ANSWER:**
```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) + # plot mpg data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + # plot points for mpg data x = displ and y = hwy
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, line = drv), se = F) # plot a line by drv tyoe and no se

```


![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9ad169a7a48c6f1493bfb9eb1d89118975304cc2/df994/visualize_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-3.png)

**ANSWER:**

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) + # plot mpg data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, col = drv)) + # plot points x = displ y = hwy and color by drive type
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, col = drv), se = F) # plot points x = displ y = hwy and color by drive type and no se

```

**ANSWER**

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) + # plot mog data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + # plot points x = displ y = hwy and color by drive type
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), se = F) # # plot points x = displ y = hwy and no se

```

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9a3c63edfc170c576ec5d34faa90df2dc2a43443/7f9e5/visualize_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-5.png)

**ANSWER**

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) + # plot mpg data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + # plot points x = displ y = hwy and color by drive type
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv ), se = F, color = "blue") # plot points x = displ y = hwy and linetype by drve, no se, and color blue

```


### (c) [10pt] Facets

There are two ways to add additional variable(s) to a 2D plot. One is using aesthetics, the other one is using facets.

(i) Make a scatter plot that x-axis is `displ` and y-axis is `hwy`. Use different colors to distinguish `drv` types.

**ANSWER**

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) +  # plot mpg data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) # plot points x = displ y = hwy and color by drive type

```

(ii) Facet `drv` into the rows. That is, make several **rows** of subplots, one row for each `drv` type. Each subplot has `displ` mapped to the x-axis and `hwy` mapped to the y-axis. **Hint**: Use `nrow` or `ncol` to control the layout of the individual panels.

**ANSWER** 

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) + # plot mpg data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + # plot points x = displ y = hwy and color by drive type
  facet_wrap( ~drv, nrow = 3) # facet wrap by drive with 3 rows

```

### (d) [10pt] `stat` functions

Most `geom` functions and `stat` functions come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. 

- every `geom` has a default `stat`
- every `stat` has a default `geom` 

Look up the default `stat` functions for the `geom` functions listed in the following table. Also, find out the variables computed by the default `stat` function (See the **Computed variables** section in the documentation page).

**ANSWER (in the table)**

| `geom` function  | default `stat` function  | variables computed by the default `stat` function  |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| `geom_bar()`        |    |    | "count"
| `geom_histogram()`  |    |    | "bin"
| `geom_density()`    |    |    | "density"
| `geom_point()`      |    |    | "identity"
| `geom_smooth()`     |    |    | "smooth"

Some `geom` function has stat = "identity" as the default. What does that mean?

**ANSWER:** we use "identity if we want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data. 

**Notes**: Table formatting are sometimes tricky using R Markdown. [Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) is a handy tool if you need to make tables in the future.


### (e) [10pt] Position adjustment options for `geom_bar()`

Choose two categorical variables from the `mpg` data set and use them to illustrate the following four position adjustment options for `geom_bar()`:

- **default**: position = "stack"
- position = "identity" will place each object exactly where it falls in the context of the graph. 
- position = "fill" works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height. 
- position = "dodge" places overlapping objects directly beside one another. 
the bars are automatically stacked. Each colored rectangle represents a combination of cut and clarity.

**ANSWER:**

```{r}

library(gridExtra) # load gridextra library
gg <- ggplot(data = mpg, # plot mpg data, with x = hwy and fill by drive
             mapping = aes(x = hwy, fill = drv)) 
plot1 <- gg + geom_bar(position="stack") # use stacks position
plot2 <- gg + geom_bar(position="identity") # use identity position
plot3 <- gg + geom_bar(position="fill") # use fill position
plot4 <- gg + geom_bar(position="dodge") # use dodge position
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, ncol=2) # arrange grid with created plots in two columns

```
Which position option do you like most? What conclusions can you draw from your plot?

**ANSWER:** I like the identity option the most. Based of my plot, I can conclude that cars with forward drive have the best highway mileage.

## **Question 2 [40pt] Visualization the `quakes` data set**
Recall that the `quakes` data set contain the locations of 1000 seismic events of MB > 4.0. The events occurred in a cube near Fiji since 1964.

```{r}
library(datasets) # load datasets library
?quakes # documentation for quakes
```

```{r, collapse=T}
class(quakes)
head(quakes, n=5) # print first 5 rows of quakes
dim(quakes)  # dimension of the table
names(quakes)  # list the variables in quakes
str(quakes)  # list the structures in quakes
glimpse(quakes) # get a glimpse of the quakes data
```

### (a) [30pt] Re-plotting the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.

In Homework 1, Question 1(a), you've plotted the distribution of the earthquake magnitudes using R base graphics. 
This week, write your own `ggplot2` code to reproduce the following four subfigures in a 2-by-2 layout.  

- subfigure #1: plot a density histogram of the earthquake magnitudes, and then plot the estimated probability density curve in red color in the same plot
- subfigure #2: plot a horizontal boxplot of the earthquake magnitudes
- subfigure #3: plot the empirical cdf of the earthquake magnitudes
- subfigure #4: make a Q-Q plot to compare the observed earthquake magnitudes distribution with the Normal distribution. Add a *thick* Q-Q line in blue color.  

**Hints**: 

- In the lecture notes, we used the `grid.arrange()` function from the `gridExtra` package (see [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/arrangeGrob.html)) to layout multiple plots in a single figure. For alternative options, please refer to [this post](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/egg/vignettes/Ecosystem.html). 
- Check out [the `geom_histogram()` function](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html) for plotting the **density** histogram.
- Check out [the `stat_ecdf()` function](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_ecdf.html) for plotting the empirical distribution.
- Check out [the `stat_qq()` and `stat_qq_line()` functions](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_qq.html) for plotting the Q-Q plot and Q-Q line.

**_YOUR_ANSWER**
```{r}

gg1 <- ggplot(data = quakes, aes(x = mag))  # plot quakes data qith x = mag
plotA <- gg1 + # plot gg1
  geom_histogram() + # make histogram
  geom_density(aes(x = mag), color = "red") # make density curve with red color
plotA # print to check
plotB <- gg1 + # plot gg1
  geom_boxplot() # plot a boxplot
plotB# print to check
plotC <- gg1 + # print gg1
  stat_ecdf() # plot ecdf
plotC # print to check
plotD <- ggplot(quakes, aes(sample = mag))+ # make plot of quakes with mpg values
  stat_qq() + # make a qq plot
  geom_qq_line() # plot a qqline
plotD # print to check
grid.arrange(plotA, plotB, plotC, plotD, ncol = 2) # arrange plots over two columns
```


### (b) [10pt] Earthquake location map

Make a scatter plot of the earthquake locations. Use `long` as the x-axis and `lat` as the y-axis. Map `mag` to the size aesthetic and `depth` to the color aesthetic.

[**Extra credit 20pt**] If you can plot earthquakes point on top of a map layer, you will earn extra points!

**ANSWER:**

```{r}

ggplot() + # ggplot
  geom_point(data = quakes, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, size = mag, color = depth)) # plot points from quakes data with x = long, y = lat, size = mag, and color by depth

```
